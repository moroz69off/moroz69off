### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love experimenting with computer graphics and web applications.

### .NET, C#, javascript, blender(3d, software), threejs
_(and others)_

##### That's how it is:
- [Earth 3D model (threejs)](https://moroz69off.github.io/earththreed/)
- [Complex chart (chartjs)](https://moroz69off.github.io/complex.chart/) , also here used [Bootstrap Multiselect](http://davidstutz.github.io/bootstrap-multiselect/) for the convenience of users.
